The **duplyaml** module is a processor for `YAML <http://www.yaml.org>`_, 
written for Python 2.x and 3.x. It is intended to provide as complete a
support of the `YAML 1.2 standard <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html>`_
as possible. This module is also intended to be correct, extensible, 
maintainable, and as compatible with Python best practices as possible. It 
would be nice for the module to be fast (but that can come later).   

The **duplyaml** library is influenced by `simplejson <http://simplejson.readthedocs.org/>`_
and `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/>`_.
